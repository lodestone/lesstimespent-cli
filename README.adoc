= lesstimespent-cli

A quick and dirty way to start and stop your current project timer on LessTimeSpent.com

== Installation

There is no install script for this. 

. Grab `lesstimespent.js` and `lts-toggle`.
. Save them in appropriate places. 

> Just copy the two main files and save them somewhere appropriate for your system. I like to stick my binaries in `~/.bin` (making sure to set your `$PATH` correspondingly). So I stick `lts-toggle` in there and save `lesstimespent.js` somewhere in my Code directories. In my case, I chose to save it in a directory that holds other casper scripts. Do what you will. Post an issue here if you need help.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
/usr/local/bin/casperjs $HOME/Sync/Code/casper/lesstimespent.js
```

```js
// lesstimespent.js
